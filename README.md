This is written with C++ language and OpenGL API.

At http://keiorogiken.wordpress.com/2013/02/10/startopengl/, I wrote the article about How to install OpenGL.

There are two AI which I programed.
First one is Routerman. His strategy is the same as mine.
Second one is Agent which I programed as well, but he is weeker than Routerman now.
So you can download source code and refine the algorithm of Agent.
Beat Routerman!


You have to install 


This program can be also used in Mac and Linux.
You have to install some packages for OpenGL and development tools, such as gcc-c++,make,etc,,

@CentOS
# yum install gcc-c++ make freeglut freeglut-devel

@Ubuntu
# apt-get install freeglut3-dev libglew1.5-dev

@Mac
nothing you have to install.
