This is written with C++ language and OpenGL API.

At http://keiorogiken.wordpress.com/2013/02/10/startopengl/, I wrote the article about How to install OpenGL.

There are two AI which I programed.
First one is Routerman. His strategy is the same as mine.
Second one is Agent which I programed as well, but he is weeker than Routerman now.
So you can download source code and refine the algorithm of Agent.
Beat Routerman!
