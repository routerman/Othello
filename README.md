This is written with C++ language and OpenGL API.

In <a ref="http://keiorogiken.wordpress.com/2013/02/10/startopengl/" target="_blank" >this site</a>, I wrote the article about How to install OpenGL.

There are two AI which I programed.
First one is Routerman. His strategy is the same as mine.

Beat Routerman!
