Othello
=======
This is Othello implemented with C++ language and OpenGL API.

I wrote the article about How to install OpenGL.
http://keiorogiken.wordpress.com/2013/02/10/startopengl/, 

There are two AI which I programed.

Routerman: The strategy is the same as creater.
Agent: I programed as well, but he is weeker than Routerman now.

So you can download source code and refine the Agent.
Beat Routerman!


You have to install 


This program can be also used in Mac and Linux.
You have to install some packages for OpenGL and development tools, such as gcc-c++,make,etc,,

@CentOS
# yum install gcc-c++ make freeglut freeglut-devel

@Ubuntu
# apt install freeglut3-dev libglew-dev

@Mac
nothing you have to install.
