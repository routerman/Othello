This is written with C++ language and OpenGL API.

In <a ref="http://keiorogiken.wordpress.com/2013/02/10/startopengl/" target="_blank" >this site</a>, I write the article about How to install OpenGL.

There are two AI which I program.

Second is Agent which I program as well, but it is weeker than Routerman now.
So you can download source code and refine the algorithm of Agent and beat Routerman!
